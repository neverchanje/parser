*LR(1)*: with just a single token of lookahead

*LALR(1)*: is hard to exzhplain simply

*IELR(1)*

*canonical LR(1)*

Parsers for LR(1) grammars are *deterministic*

#### Operator Precedence & Associative

+ %left

    left associative

+ %right

    right associative

In general, (+, -) and (*, /) is left associative, which means 7-4+2 = (7-4)+2.

In both of the associative declaration, precedence is increasing from left to right.

#### Operator Grammar

No production right side is epsilon, or has two adjacent nonterminal.
